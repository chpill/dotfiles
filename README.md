dotfiles
========

Config files and installations scripts for my config.

Use these scripts at your own risk!

To install the config:
---------------------
(this currently doesn't work...)

    curl -L https://github.com/chpill/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh

TODO:
-----
- finding a way of using curl inside the install script (haxx.curl -> curl scripting?)
- adding an automated custom install of oh-my-zsh inside the dotfiles directory
- adding more config files...
